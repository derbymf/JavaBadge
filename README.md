I decided to do this project mainly as a refresher in Java. I decided to make a program that tells which teams are going to be in the college football playoff games and who plays in which games and when.

I first created an arraylist of the teams who are participating in the playoff. I then printed out the list to make sure each were added correctly. I then mapped each matchup in a hash map with the date in which they played. I then created a for loop that went through each hash map and printed out who was playing and on what date.

I think this could e a useful program to anyone who is needing a quick and fun refresher for Java.
